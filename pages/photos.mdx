## Description

A real-time chess game that allows for user accounts (using devise), PGN (portable game notation), and FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation). This allows you to review an entire game on something like [Chess.com](https://chess.com) and analyze each play.

This app was built to showcase how quick it is to put together a somewhat impressive concept in a very short amount of time (an afternoon).

The app uses clientside Chess.Js to handle game logic. This has its flaws as you _could_ modify the outbound data to set your pieces to any position you want. Again, these things are preventable but outside the scope of what this project aimed to showcase.
