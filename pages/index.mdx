# Drew Hoffer

Hey there, I'm Drew ü§†. A software developer working for Brock Solutions. I used to run Carbon Software and before that Sitekick where we built all types of different projects for new startups using a lot of cool tools.
This site is my personal playground to showcase to the world how web apps work, are built, and anything else I might find interesting.

Feel free to check out my projects on [Github](https://github.com/drewhoffer)
 or reach out to collaborate!
