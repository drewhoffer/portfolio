# My first post

I learned a ton running my own tech company over the last few years but I could never find time to myself to build out my own projects using the technologies I was interested in.

I am using this portfolio site as an incentive to start building things with the technologies I love (basically all of them). Although I LOVE using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) stack, it can definitely get old.

There are millions of technologies out there, why limit yourself to a select few? Time to learn some new tech ðŸ¤“.

Anyways, I'm expecting my first real post to be about how this site was built and explain how NextJs is working under the hood to serve up these page's.

Stay tuned.
