## 24 Hour Startup

I wonder what I can build in 24-hours. I normally spin tires and get distracted. I've got about 5000 sticky notes in front of me with todo items but honestly, I want to take a step back and do something for me.

I've always helped others with building their projects and that's been great but today I want to try something else. I'm so used to being given a problem and finding ways to solve it. 

I want to challenge my brain by trying to come up with the problem first and getting it solved as quickly as possible. It's a slight tweak in thinking, basically instead of the problem being solved I need to think of things that I find could be solved THEN solve it.

I'm thinking it's going to be some sort of ProductHunt/Fiverr merge, I will update this post with a link by Saturday. 

Wish me luck!
