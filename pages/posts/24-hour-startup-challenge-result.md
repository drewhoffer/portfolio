## Result

Ok, I know this is 2 days after a 24-hour challenge but there were some unexpected personal things that came up so let's just call it a weekend hackathon.

That being said, I'm really happy with what is left: [Hunterr](https://hunterr.ca).

## Hunterr

What is Hunterr? It's a new startup I created this weekend that is a blend of [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/). The idea blends having a place for startups to post their new idea and collaborate with others with the idea of Fiverr which is basically -- leverage others talents. I really dig the idea and will probably continue to develop it further.


Basically, you post your idea (keep the trade secrets to yourself of course), others can then apply to it. You get an email, you two talk, and, if it's a good fit, accept and Boom, you now have a new collaborator on your project. 

This has always been an issue for me where I want to work on a cool idea but may not have the expertise mixed with the time to be able to do say... design, marketing, etc.

## Takeaways

I learned a few things which I will be writing posts about later. The main timesink was with Kamal, I have to bump up my Digital Ocean container registry plan and Kamal cached the old one so it lead to.... hours.... and hours being sunk. Honestly, probably half of all the time spent was on this (about 3 hours). At least I was able to [let others know](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal/discussions/1199#discussioncomment-13399393) as a result and hopefully save others time.

This was also a fun experiment where I got to see how far I could get with only myself as the roadblock. I would sit and futz around with things like the styles on the tags inputs but then realize that it doesn't matter. This lead to me actually getting to build something real instead of getting bogged down in meaningless "nice to haves".

Anyways, give it a try, I might be taking it down but for now just sign up and post your ideas. Who knows maybe someone will want to collaborate!
