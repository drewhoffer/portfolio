# Drew Hoffer Portfolio site

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). Pages can be built with Markdown, this makes it more likely that I actually write some posts as deployment is simple and blogs are easy to style/write.


## Features: 
- Automatically convert Markdown/MDX to pages
- Generates an RSS feed based on my posts
- Easily categorize posts with tags
